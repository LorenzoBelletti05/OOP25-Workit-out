WorkItout is a java-based desktop application designed to connect the personalized fitness training and nutritional tracking. It provides users with a data-driven approach to health management by combining bio-metric analysis with algorithmic workout generation.

User Guide
Upon launching the application, you will see the User Profile setup screen (for first-time users) or the Dashboard directly (if a profile has already been saved).

User Profile: Enter your first name, last name, age, height (cm), weight (kg), sex, activity level, and goal. You can choose the formula for calculating your Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR) between Mifflin-St Jeor and Harris-Benedict. Clicking the confirm button saves your data and opens the dashboard.

Dashboard: The dashboard displays a profile summary, including target daily calories, target macronutrients, and a tracker for calories consumed and burned.

Available Modules:
Profile: Modify your personal data and physical metrics at any time.

Food Diary: Search for foods and filter them by category (high protein, low fat, or low carb). Record your consumption by clicking on a food item and specifying the amount in grams.

Workout Plan: View your automatically generated weekly plan. You can adjust exercise intensity, and once you click on a completed exercise, the burned calories are updated in your profile.

Wiki & Exercise List: Consult articles and videos with contextual suggestions based on your profile and recent activities. You can also explore the complete list of available exercises.

Note: The "Back" button in each module will return you to the main dashboard.
